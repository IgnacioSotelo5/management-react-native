# Authentication Flow Changes Confirmation

The authentication system has been completely overhauled to fix several incorrect behaviors. What started as a simple fix evolved into a larger refactor, including:

## Structural Changes
- Reorganized folder structure by moving from `app/(app)/(tabs)` to a simplified `app/(tabs)`
- Removed redundant layout files and consolidated navigation structure
- Added new error handling structure with `api/errors/`

## Authentication Logic Improvements
- Enhanced token validation in `auth.context.tsx`
- Added session validation state tracking (`isSessionValidated`)
- Improved error handling in login flow with new `ApiError` implementation
- Added proper redirection after signup

## UI/UX Enhancements
- Added error message display in login screen
- Improved loading state indicators during authentication processes
- Updated navigation flow for authenticated and non-authenticated states

## Technical Updates
- Updated multiple Expo and React Native dependencies to latest compatible versions
- Added error handling utilities with new `useApiError` hook

These changes provide a more robust and maintainable authentication system with better error handling and user feedback.
